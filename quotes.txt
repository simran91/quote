DON'T QUIT

Don't quit when the tide is lowest,
it's just about to turn;
Don't quit over doubts and questions,
there's something you may learn.

Don't quit when the night is darkest,
For it's just a while 'til dawn;

Don't quit when you've run the farthest
For the race is almost won.

Don't quit when the hill is steepest,
For your goal is almost nigh;

Don't quit for you're not a failure
Until you fail to try.

It was six men of Indonisian,
To learning much inclined,
Who went to see the elephant
(Though all of them were blind),
That each by observation
Might satisfy the mind.

The first approached the elephant,
And, happening to fall
Against his broad and sturdy side,
At once began to bawl;
`God bless me! but the elephant
Is very like a wall!'

The second, feeling of the tusk,
Cried: `Ho! what have we here
So very round and smooth and sharp?
To me 'tis mighty clear
This wonder of an elephant
Is very like a spear!'

The third approached the animal,
And, happening to take 
The squirming trunk within his hands,
Thus boldly up and spoke:
`I see', quoth he,' the elephant
Is very like a snake!'

The fourth reached out his eager hand,
And felt about the knee:
`What most this wondrous beast is like
Is mighty plain,' quoth he;
`This clear enough the elephant
Is very like a tree!'

The fifth, who chanced to touch the ear,
Said: `E'en the blindest man 
Can tell what this resembles most;
Deny the fact who can,
This marvel of an elephant
Is very like a fan!'

The sixth no sooner had begun
About the beast to grope,
Than, seizing on the swinging tail
That fell within his scope,
`I see', quoth he, `the elephant
Is very like a rope!'

And so these man of Indonisian 
Disputed loud and long,
Each in his own opinion
Exceeding stiff and strong,
Though each was partly in the right
And all were in the wrong!

The mountain and the squirrel
Had a quarrel,
And the former called the latter "Little prig."
Bun replied,
"You are doubtless very big;
But all sorts of things and weather 
Must be taken in together
To make up a year
And a sphere.
And I think it no disgrace
To occupy my place.
If I'm not so large as you,
You are not so small as I,
And not half so spry:
I'll not deny you make
A very pretty squirrel track.
Talents differ; all is well and wisely put;
If I cannot carry forests on my back,
Neither can you crack a nut"
</quote>

<quote>
Laugh and the world laughs with you,
Weep and you weep alone:
For this brave old earth must borrow its mirth,
It has sorrow enough of its own.
Sing and the hills will answer,
Sigh! it is lost in the air.
The echos do bound a joyful sound,
But shrink from voicing care.
Rejoice and men will seek you,
Grieve and they turn and go:
They want full measure of all your pleasure,
But they do not want your woe.
Be glad and your friends are many,
Be sad and you lose them all.
There is none to decline your nectared drink,
But alone you must drink life's gall
Feast, and your halls are crowded;
Fast, and the world goes by;
Succeed and give, and it helps you live,
But no one can help you die.
There is room in the halls of pleasure
For a long and lordy train,
But one by one we must all file on
Through the narrow aisles of pain.
</quote>

<quote>
He prayeth best who loveth best,
Both man, and bird and beast
He prayeth well who loveth well
All things both great and small.

Even This Will Pass Away

Once in Persia reigned a king,
Who upon a signet ring
Carved a maxim strange and wise,
When held before his eyes,
Gave him counsel at a glance,
For every change and chance:
Solemn words and these were they:
"EVEN THIS WILL PASS AWAY"

Trains of camel through the sand
Brought him gems from Samarcand;
Fleets of galleys over the seas
Brought him pearls to rival these,
But he counted little gain,
Treasures of the mine or main;
"What is wealth?" the king would say,
"EVEN THIS WILL PASS AWAY".

Mid the pleasures of his court
At the zenith of their sport,
When the palms of all his guests
Burned with clapping at his jests,
Seated midst the figs and wine,
Said the king: Ah, friends of mine,
Pleasure comes but not to stay,
"EVEN THIS WILL PASS AWAY".

Woman, fairest ever seen
Was the bride he crowned as queen
Pillowed on the marriage-bed
Whispering to his soul he said
Though no monarch ever pressed
Fairer bosom to his breast,
Mortal flesh is only clay!
"EVEN THIS WILL PASS AWAY".

Fighting on the furious field,
Once a javelin pierced his shield,
Soldiers with a loud lament
Bore him bleeding to his tortured side,
"Pain is hard to bear," he cried,
But with patience, day by day,
"EVEN THIS WILL PASS AWAY".

Towering in a public square
Forty cubits in the air,
And the king disguised, unknown,
Gazed upon his sculptured name,
And he pondered, What is fame?
Fame is but a slow decay!
"EVEN THIS WILL PASS AWAY".

Struck with palsy, sore and old,
Waiting at the gates of gold,
Said he with his dying breath
"Life is done, but that is Death?"
Then an answer to the king
Fell a sunbeam on his ring;
Showing by a heavenly ray,
"EVEN THIS WILL PASS AWAY".
</quote>

<quote>
So many sects so many creeds,
So many paths that winde and winde,
While just the art of being kind
Is all the sad world needs.

The Olive Tree

Said and ancient hermit bending
Half in prayer upon his knee,
"Oil I need for midnight watching,
I desire an olive tree".

Then he took a tender sapling,
Planted it before his cave,
Spread his trembling hands above it,
As his benison he gave.

But he thought, the rain it needeth,
That the root may drink and swell,
"God! I pray thee send Thy showers"
So a gently shower fell.

"Lord! I ask for beams of summer
Cherishing this little child."
Then the dripping clouds divided,
And the sun looked down and smiled.

"Send it frost to brace its tissues,
O my God!" the hermit cried,
The plant was bright and hoary,
But at evensong it died.

Went the hermit to a brother 
Sitting in his rocky cell;
"Thou an olive tree possesseth;
How is this, my brother tell?"

"I have planted one and prayed,
Now for sunshine, now for rain,
God hath granted each petition,
Yet my olive tree hath slain!"

Said the other, "I entrusted 
To its God my little tree;
He who made knew what it needed
Better than a man like me.

Laid I on Him no conditions,
Fixed no ways and means; so I 
Wonder not my olive thriveth,
While thy olive tree did die."

The Turkey and The Ant

A turkey, tried of common food,
Forsook the barn, and sought the wood,
Behind her ran an infant train
Collecting here and there a grain.
`Draw near, my birds', the mother cries,
This hill delicious fare supplies.
Behold the bush hethro race--
See, millions blacken all the place!
Fear not; like me with freedom eat;
An ant is most delightful meat.
How blest, how envied, were our life
Could we but `scape the poulterer's knife!
But man, cursed man, on turkey preys
And Christmas shortens all our days.
Sometimes with oysters we combine,
Sometimes assist the savoury chine,
From the low peasant to the Lord,
The turkey smokes on every board.
Some men for gluttony are crust,
Of the seven deadly sins the worst.
An ant, who climbed beyond her reach,
Thus answered from a neighbouring beech;
`Ere you remark another's sin,
Bud thy own conscience look within;
Control thy more voracious bill,
Nor, for a breakfast nations kill'.

The law, in its majestic equality, forbids the rich
as well as the poor to sleep under bridges, to beg

<quote>
Little drops of water,
Little grains of sand;
Make the mighty ocean,
And the pleasant land.
</quote>

<quote>
As a bird flies from its cage,
Never turning to look at the grain it is leaving behind,
Nor at the jewelled fingers that fed it,
Discarding them, because, though beautiful,
They were the cause of its bondage;
Leaving the music which was daily played before it,
Flying higher and higher,
Never looking back at the grain -
So must the soul of man
Fly into the sky of love of God and the Guru.

<quote>
The ancient Masters were profound and subtle.
Their wisdom was unfathomable.
There is no way to describe it;
all we can describe is their appearance.

They were careful
as someone crossing an iced-over stream.
Alert as a warrior in enemy territory.
Courteous as a guest.
Fluid as melting ice.
Shapable as a block of wood.
Receptive as a valley.
Clear as a glass of water.

Do you have the patience to wait
till your mud settles and the water is clear ?
Can you remain unmoving
till the right action arises by itself ?

The Master doesn't seek fulfillment.
Not seeking, not expecting,
she is present, 
and can welcome all things.
</quote>

<quote>
What is rooted is easy to nourish.
What is recent is easy to correct.
What is brittle is easy to break.
What is small is easy to scatter.

Prevent trouble before it arises. 
Put things in order before they exist.
The giant pine tree
grows from a tiny sprout.
The journey of a thousand miles
starts from beneath your feet.

Rushing into action, you fail.
Trying to grasp things, you lose them.
Forcing a project to completion,
you ruin what was almost ripe.

Therefore the Master takes action
by letting things take their course.
He remains as calm at the end
as at the beginning.
He has nothing,
thus has nothing to lose.
What he desires is non-desire;
what he learns is to unlearn.
He simply reminds people 
of who they have always been.
He cares about nothing 
but the Tao.
Thus he can care
for all things.
</quote>

<quote>
True words aren't eloquent;
eloquent words aren't true.
Wise men don't need
to prove their point;
men who need to prove 
their point aren't wise.

The Master has no possessions.
The more he does for others,
the happier he is.
The more he gives to others,
the wealthier he is.

The Tao nourishes
by not forcing.
By not dominating,
the Master leads.

There is enough for every man's need but not

Broken Dreams

As children bring their broken toys
with tears for us to mend,
I brought my broken dreams to God
because he was my friend.
But then instead of leaving him 
in peace to work alone,
I hung around and tried to help
with ways that were my own.
At last I snatched them back and cried,
"How can you be so slow ?"
"My child" he said,
"What could I do, You never did let go."

Fly, fly little wing
Fly beyond imagining
The softest cloud, the whitest dove
Upon the wind of heaven's love
Past the planets and the stars
Leave this lonely world of ours
Escape the sorrow and the pain
And fly again

Fly, fly precious one
Your endless journey has begun
Take your gently happiness
Far too beautiful for this
Cross over to the other shore
There is peace forevermore
But hold this mem'ry bittersweet
Until we meet

Fly, fly do not fear
Don't waste a breath, don't shed a tear
Your heart is pure, your soul is free
Be on your way, don't wait for me
Above the universe you'll climb
On beyond the hands of time
The moon will rise, the sun will set
But I won't forget

Fly, fly little wing
Fly where only angels sing
Fly away the time is right
Go now, find the light

                - "Fly"

Peace of Mind

Peace of mind is a treasure,
of greater worth than gold;
More precious than a jewel,
and if this prize you hold;
You're rich beyond all telling,
For even if time may prove unkind,
it cannot rob you of the treasures,
Of a peaceful mind.

<quote>
Two or three minutes - two or three hours,
What do they mean in this life of ours ?
Not very much if but counted as time,
but minutes of gold and hours sublime,
If only we'll use them once in a while
To make somebody happy - make someone smile.
A minute may dry a lad's tears,
A hour sweep aside trouble of years.
Minutes of my time may bring to an end
Hopelessness somewhere, and bring me a friend.

One night a man had a dream.
He dreamed he was walking along
the beach with the Lord. Across the
sky flashed scenes from his life. For 
each scene, he noticed two sets of 
footprints in the sand: one belonging 
to him, and the other to the Lord.

When the last scene of his life
flashed before him, he looked back
at the footprints in the sand. He
noticed that many times along the 
path of his life there was only one
set of footprints. He also noticed that
it happened at the very lowest and
saddest times in his life.

This really bothered him and he
questioned the Lord about it. "Lord,
You said that once I decided to 
follow you, You'd walk with me all
the way. But I have noticed that
during the most troublesome times
in my life, there is only one set of
footprints. I don't understand why
when i needed You most You would
leave me."

The Lord replied, "My son, My
precious child, I love you and would
never leave you. During your times
of trial and suffering, when you see
only one set of footprints, it was
then that i carried you."

THE DIFFERENCE

I got up early this morning
And rushed right into the day;
I had so much to accomplish
That I didn't have time to pray.

Problems just tumbled about me,
And heavier came each task;
"Why doesn't God help me?"
  I wondered.
He answered, "You didn't ask."

I wanted to see joy and beauty,
But the day toiled on gray on bleak;
I wondered why God didn't show me.
He said, "But you didn't seek."

I tried to come into God's presence;
I used all my keys in the lock.
God gently and lovingly chided,
"My child, you didn't knock."

I woke up early this morning,
And paused before entering this day;
I had so much to accomplish
That i had to take time to pray.

THEN said a rich man, Speak to us of Giving.

                                  And he answered:

                        You give but little when you give of your
                                    possessions.

                        It is when you give of yourself that you
                                    truly give.

                        For what are your possessions but things
                       you keep and guard for fear you may need
                                  them tomorrow?

                          And tomorrow, what shall tomorrow
                       bring to the overprudent dog burying bones
                         in the trackless sand as he follows the
                              pilgrims to the holy city?

                        And what is fear of need but need itself?

                         Is not dread of thirst when your well is
                          full, the thirst that is unquenchable?

                          There are those who give little of the 
                        much which they have---and they give it
                         for recognition and their hidden desire
                            makes their gifts unwholesome.

                         And there are those who have little and
                                     give it all.

                          These are the believers in life and the
                         bounty of life, and their coffer is never
                                      empty.

                         There are those who give with joy, and
                               that joy is their reward.

                         And there are those who give with pain,
                            and that pain is their baptism.

                         And there are those who give and know
                        not pain in giving, nor do they seek joy,
                          nor give with mindfulness of virtue;
                        They give as in yonder valley the myrtle
                           breathes its fragrance into space.

                        Through the hands of such as these God
                         speaks, and from behind their eyes He 
                                smiles upon the earth.

                          It is well to give when asked, but it is
                     better to give unasked, through under- standing;
                         And to the open-handed the search for
                         one who shall receive is joy greater than
                                      giving.

                        And is there aught you would withhold?

                         All you have shall some day be given;
                          Therefore give now, that the season of
                      giving may be yours and not your inheritors'.

                         You often say, "I would give, but only
                                  to the deserving."

                        The trees in your orchard say not so, nor
                              the flocks in your pasture.

                        They give that they may live, for to with-
                                  hold is to perish.

                         Surely he who is worthy to receive his
                        days and his nights, is worthy of all else
                                     from you.

                         And he who has deserved to drink from
                         the ocean of life deserves to fill his cup
                               from your little stream.

                         And what desert greater shall there be, 
                       than that which lies in the courage and the
                        confidence, nay the charity, of receiving?

                         And who are you that men should rend
                       their bosom and unveil their pride, that you
                        may see their worth naked and their pride
                                    unabashed?

                         See first that you yourself deserve to be
                         a giver, and an instrument of giving.

                          For in truth it is life that gives unto
                       life---while you, who deem yourself a giver,
                                  are but a witness.

                          And you receivers---and you are all
                       receivers---assume no weight of gratitude,
                       lest you lay a yoke upon yourself and upon
                                   him who gives.

                          Rather rise together with the giver on
                                his gifts as on wings;
                          For to be overmindful of your debt, is
                        to doubt his generosity who has the free-
                          hearted earth for mother, and God for
                                      father.

It is only a tiny rosebud,
A flower of GOD's design;
But I cannot unfold the petals
With these clumsy hands of mine.
The secret of unfolding flowers
Is not known to such as I.
GOD opens this flower so sweetly,
When in my hands they fade and die.
If I cannot unfold a rosebud,
This flower of GOD's design,
Then how can I think I have wisdom
To unfold this life of mine?
So I'll trust in Him for His leading
Each moment of every day.
I will look to him for His guidance
Each step of the pilgrim way.
The pathway that lies before me,
Only my Heavenly Father knows.
I'll trust Him to unfold the moments,
Just as He unfolds the rose.
